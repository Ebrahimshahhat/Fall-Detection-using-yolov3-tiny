# Fall-Detection-using-yolov3-tiny
it's developed for low-end devices and will work with a fair fps 
It uses Pushover API to send notifications to a mobile device 
you must download yolov3-tiny.weights from :https://github.com/smarthomefans/darknet-test/blob/master/yolov3-tiny.weights

# Usage
1- Edit the API key and token key for your Pushover account
2- edit the video capture device "Choose what you wanna work on "
3- run the script and it will work perfectly 

# limitation 
1-the model is not so accurate but the algorithm at some point will detect the fall and it will immediately send the alert
2-It's working on the CPU only because it's directed to low-end devices
